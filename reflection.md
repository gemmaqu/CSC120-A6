What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think unit testing is pretty hard at first but the more you do the easier it would be. For me, the hardest part is the passenger class because I think void cannot be used to do junit test.
Advice: Start early, go to Ta hours if you can't figure out by yourself.
