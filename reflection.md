What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

resubmission reflection:
I am always very confused about why I can't compile the test. And I found it was because I have a logic error in my original Car class. After I fix the logic error in the Car class, all the test passed!!




Original reflection:
I think unit testing is pretty hard at first but the more you do the easier it would be. For me, the hardest part is the passenger class because I think void cannot be used to do junit test.
Advice: Start early, go to Ta hours if you can't figure out by yourself.
